Hi, I am Christian ðŸ‘‹.

Iâ€™m currently working on [New Game](https://github.com/TeamSose/NewGame), a game, probably in 2D designed with a team of 3.
Iâ€™m currently doing [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?index=product&queryID=2e3cd31558e1d569e29c21dcad43b8ed&position=1), Harvard's introduction to computer science and programming.
Soon to be student at [Paderborn University](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/) in [computer science](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/studium/studienangebot/informatik)
